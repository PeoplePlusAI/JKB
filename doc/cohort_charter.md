# Jan Ki Baat Cohort Charter

## Introduction

The Jan Ki Baat (JKB) Cohort by People+AI is a transformative 7-8 week program designed to empower organizations to harness AI for large-scale user engagement. This initiative unites private sectors, startups, governmental agencies, and nonprofits in a collaborative effort to enhance public listening capabilities without distortion. Through the program, participants convert conversations into actionable insights, driving improvements in service delivery and making a tangible impact on communities.

## Scope

The JKB Cohort transforms participant-driven use cases into proof of concepts (POCs) or pilot projects within a 7-8 week timeframe. The structured phases include kickoff, ideation, prototype development, scaling, and pilot launch. Support ranges from design and development guidance to access to technical resources and mentorship from industry veterans at People+AI.

## Vision

Our vision is to foster an Adbhut India where AI-driven insights enable organizations to refine public services, tackle societal challenges, and enhance product and service offerings effectively.
