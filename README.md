# Jan Ki Baat: AI-Driven Citizen Feedback Platform

## Introduction
**Jan Ki Baat (JKB)** is an initiative by **People+AI** designed to revolutionize how governments and organizations gather real-time feedback from citizens. By leveraging **AI-powered voice bots**, JKB enables large-scale, authentic feedback collection, empowering decision-makers with actionable, data-driven insights.

## The Problem
Governments and organizations today face a significant challenge: understanding the true needs and concerns of citizens. Traditional feedback mechanisms are costly, slow, and often distorted by intermediaries. This leaves a critical gap in how policies are informed and services are improved, especially in rural and underserved areas.

- **What if you**, as a citizen, had a single phone number to directly share feedback about public services?
- **What if your government** could respond to your needs as efficiently as companies like Amazon?
- **What if decision-makers** could instantly launch real-time user research programs without being bogged down by bureaucracy?

Currently, public services are disconnected from the people they serve, relying on outdated and filtered information. This creates a gap in trust and understanding, particularly for rural communities.

## The Solution
**Jan Ki Baat** offers a simple, scalable, and cost-effective solution to this disconnect. By enabling citizens to provide real-time feedback through phone calls, JKB bridges the gap between policy-makers and the public, transforming how governments listen and respond.

- **Single Access Point**: A single phone number allows citizens to share feedback about public services.
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Using AI voice bots, we enable natural conversations in multiple languages, making the system accessible to citizens from all walks of life.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Feedback is instantly processed and analyzed, allowing governments to act quickly on citizen needs.
- **Scalable & Inclusive**: This approach enables large-scale feedback collection, reaching even the most remote communities in their local languages, ensuring their voices are heard.

## Cohort Information
**Jan Ki Baat** launched its first experimental cohort, partnering with **12 organizations** and **8 technology platforms**. This pilot tested the feasibility of large-scale feedback collection across different use cases, such as:

- Identifying beneficiaries for government schemes like old-age pensions.
- Assessing the impact of monsoon floods in regions like Assam.
- Verifying the satisfaction levels of beneficiaries of programs like Ayushman Bharat.
- Understanding user behavior in Tier 2/3 cities for mobile commerce providers.

### Key Highlights from the Cohort:
- **12 Organizations** were selected from **40 applications** (Non-profit: 5, For-profit: 7).
- **1000+ Calls** were made, gathering real-time feedback across diverse use cases.
- **8 Infrastructure Providers** were onboarded to deliver multilingual capabilities.
- **Insights**: The pilot revealed critical learnings about language support, technology challenges, and best practices to increase call success rates, especially in Hindi and English.

### Next Steps for the Cohort:
- Focus on scaling to reach **1 million calls** across multiple languages.
- Partner with state governments to integrate **JKB** into public service delivery.
- Continue refining the AI system to support more regional dialects and improve user engagement.
