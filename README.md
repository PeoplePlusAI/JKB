# Jan Ki Baat - Nadella Demo
## Deadline: Jan 31, 2024

### Grand narrative:
What if you as a citizen and a recipient of a specific government service has access to a single phone number that you can ring up and give feedback?
What if you could get your government to be as responsive to your needs as amazon?

### Secondary narrative:
What if a minister/Permanent Secretary can spin up a direct user research program on the fly instead of going through his/her chain of command?
There is a massive machinery between the people who think up policies and the citizens who benefit from it. This machinery functions top-down, broadcast one-way. What if this mechanism could have good, current, detailed feedback from the people it is supposed to help? This is Jan ki Baat
Imagine being able to “Listen to your customers/citizens” at scale.

### Holy Grail Demo:
_Consumer/Household survey to measure household well-being in India_
- The consumer pyramids household survey is an entirely qualitative interview process to estimate income, expense, employment patterns of 1M+ people in India https://consumerpyramidsdx.cmie.com/
- The questionnaire is constructed in English. The English construction is straight forward because the questions seek factual information. However, the final interview is conducted in the local dialect and this necessitates a conversational interview. A translation into the principal local languages of India is useful only upto a point. The stated constructs are rarely read out. They are interpreted and explained to the principal respondent.

### First Cut Demo: Deadline: Dec 29
Can we build a simple and fun listening bot which works like a decent journalist asking fans _what went wrong with India’s cricket world cup campaign_?

### We want to learn and accomplish:
- How to design a bot that’s engaging, empathetic and asks intuitive follow up questions based on the user’s answers
- Infrastructure to understand and categorise a variety of emotional responses. [e.g. Some people being angry. Some being sympathetic. Some being neutral]
- Infrastructure to simulate a variety of responses and prepare a neat dashboard with charts and all
- Low latency, streamed responses/questions from the bot itself, including TTS and ASR.
- English only, for now.
